# Pose Estimation

[ [日本語](<pose_estimation(jp).md>) ]

## Implementation

This repo is a direct implementation of [Detection2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) made by [Facebook Research](https://github.com/facebookresearch). Pretrained models were used. The code was mostly copied from the [official colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD_-m5?usp=sharing), as well as [this blogpost](https://www.ushiji.online/detectron2) made by [Ushiji](https://twitter.com/ushiji_12). This repo was made mostly for my own usage, and has been written in a way so that I can perform pose estimation on an input video.

## Intuition

Pose Estimation is, as the name suggests, the task of estimating a human's pose. The most common implementation of this is 2d-pose estimation, but other variants include 3d-pose estimation and mesh-estimation.
